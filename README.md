## Problem Statement
Our group needed a simple way to convert multiple GBP amounts to EUR quickly and accurately. Manual conversion is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with multiple values.

**Challenge**: Create an automated tool that can convert a list of GBP amounts to EUR using a fixed exchange rate.
